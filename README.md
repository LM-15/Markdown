# Markdown

## What is it?
* Way to stylize text on the web (a free text to HTML conversion tool)
* Can use in many places in Github: gists (whatever those are); comments in issues and pull requests; files with .md or .markdown extensions

## Commonly used syntax:
* Italic
  * an asterisk or underscore in front and at the end of text (no spaces)
* Bold
  * 2 asterisks or 2 underscores in front and at the end of text (no spaces)

## Unordered lists:
* One asterisk in front of each line in the list; put a space between the asterisk and the text
  * If you want to indent elements of the list, add two tabs, then add the asterisk, a space and the text
