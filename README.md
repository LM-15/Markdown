# Markdown

## What is it?
* Way to stylize text on the web (a free text to HTML conversion tool)
* Can use in many places in Github: gists (whatever those are); comments in issues and pull requests; files with .md or .markdown extensions

## Commonly used syntax:
* Italic
  * an asterisk or underscore in front and at the end of text (no spaces)
* Bold
 * 2 asterisks or 2 underscores in front and at the end of text (no spaces)



*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
